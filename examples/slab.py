    """Create a 3D MPB simulation of a uniform slab with thickness 1 in air.

    *material* is the material of the slab, *substrate_material* is the
    material of the substrate below the slab.
    *material* and *substrate_material* can be strings (e.g. SiN,
    4H-SiC-anisotropic_c_in_z; defined in data.py) or just the epsilon
    value (float); By default, *substrate_material* is 1, i.e. air.
    *numbands* is the number of bands to calculate.
    *k_interpolation* is the number of k-vectors between every two of
    the used high symmetry points Gamma, X, M and Gamma again, so the
    total number of simulated k-vectors will be 3*k_interpolation + 4.
    *resolution* and *mesh_size* are as described in MPB documentation.
    *supercell_z* is the height of the supercell in units of lattice
    constant;
    *runmode* can be one of the following:
        ''       : just create and return the simulation object
        'ctl'    : create the sim object and save the ctl file
        'sim' (default): run the simulation and do all postprocessing
        'postpc' : do all postprocessing; simulation should have run before!
        'display': display all pngs done during postprocessing. This is the
                   only mode that is interactive.
    *convert_field_patterns* indicates whether field pattern h5 files
    should be converted to png (only when postprocessing).
    Optionally specify a *job_name_suffix* (appendix to the folder name
    etc.) which will be appended to the jobname created automatically
    from the most important parameters.
    Specify *bands_title_appendix*, which will be added to the title
    of the bands diagram.
